# Project Name : Portfolio

This is the Portfolio of Mike van Eckendonk as a page to show all the work he did.

This repo is an almost exact copy of the template that is hosted on figma.com. You can find the template here:

https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=48%3A27

This is a mobile version of the figma template 2 and has many pages.
I used VScode as my editor and created the files needed for this project
